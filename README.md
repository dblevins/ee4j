# Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J)

Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) is an open source initiative to create standard APIs, implementations of those APIs, and technology compatibility kits for Java runtimes that enable development, deployment, and management of server-side and cloud-native applications.  EE4J is based on the Javaâ„¢ Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) standards, and uses Java EE 8 as the baseline for creating new standards.
